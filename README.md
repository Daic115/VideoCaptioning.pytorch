# VideoCaptioning.pytorch

Video captioning in Pytorch based on [hobincar/SA-LSTM](https://github.com/hobincar/SA-LSTM).

## Todo 
- [x] MSVD and MSR-VTT dataset EDA (see `dataset_eda/dataeda.ipynb`)
- [x] 2d Feature extraction
- [ ] 3d Feature extraction (follow [this issue](https://github.com/hobincar/SA-LSTM/issues/10))
- [ ] BUTD Feature extraction
- [ ] Temporal augmentation
- [ ] Joint-Hierarchical Attention Model
- [ ] Full pretrained models (Cider 50.3 for MSR-VTT, 97.1 for MSVD)
